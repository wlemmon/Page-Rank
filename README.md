# Page-Rank

Named after Larry Page, page rank was the original ranking algorithm which inspired the Google search engine. You can read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank

I have implemented the algorithm in python, and used numpy to broadcast/reduce the weight propogation step as a single |E|-long vector.
